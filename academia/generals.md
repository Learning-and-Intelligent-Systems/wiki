# General exam

The [official general exam document](https://www.cs.washington.edu/students/grad/generals/requirements) is comprehensive and authoritative.
However, there are some confusions which we clarified with the CSE advisors.

## Who writes the charge?
The charge is written by the advisor and the student together, then the advisor sends the charge to the whole committee, the student, and the CSE advisor.

## How long after the charge is released should the general exam be scheduled?
4-8 weeks.
There is no official minimum time between the charge and the exam.
However, the response to the charge must be turned in 2 weeks before the exam, so at least 4 weeks is typical.
The official maximum is 8 weeks.

## Are there different formats for the response?
There are at least three kinds of charges/responses.
The general exam document focuses on one particular kind of charge/response which has become less common, but leaves the door open for the other, more recently-popular formats.
The different kinds of formats are listed at the bottom of the general exam document.
