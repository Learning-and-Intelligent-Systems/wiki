# How to review papers

Some resources:
- [How I review Papers](http://blogs.cornell.edu/danco/2014/06/12/how-i-review-papers/), blog post by Daniel Cosley, Cornell. Describes reviewer's approach/process for reviewing. Outlines how to structure a review (the written part you submit). Includes notes from pseudo-reviews of a few example papers.
- The [HRI 2017 external review guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v11j-qeGaaGg3SNONlZUrSdPajNL4VWqLMwOMoKDIpI/edit) are also very good and similar to the link above.
- [How to get me to positively review your CHI paper](http://lanayarosh.com/2012/10/how-to-get-me-to-positively-review-your-chi-paper/), blog post by Lana Yarosh, University of Minnesota. What the reviewer looks for in each section of a CHI paper.
