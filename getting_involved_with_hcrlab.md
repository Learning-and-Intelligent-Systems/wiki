# So you want to join the HCR Lab...

This document is targeted towards undergraduate students interested in working in the Human-Centered Robotics Lab.
However, it can apply to anyone who is potentially interested in doing research with us.

*Other HCR Lab researchers feel free to edit, dissent, or add your own opinions.*

## What we do
The mission of the lab, broadly speaking, is to make robots useful for people.
We focus on robots that could be around people in everyday settings, like the [PR2](https://www.willowgarage.com/pages/pr2/overview), [Kubi](https://www.revolverobotics.com/), [Relay](http://www.savioke.com/), or [Turtlebot](http://www.turtlebot.com/).
We are especially interested in the field of [human-robot interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93robot_interaction).

## How do we differ from other labs at UW CSE?
Other labs at UW CSE tend to work on developing core robotics technologies, while our lab tends to integrate technologies to build behaviors, interactions, and interfaces.
This doesn't mean we aren't technical or that we don't develop new robotics technologies ourselves.
It just means we focus on different research areas.

## What skills do I need?
If you are interested in a programming project, you most likely will want to learn to use:
- Ubuntu Linux
- Code-editing tools in Linux such as vim, emacs, Sublime, or an IDE like Eclipse
- C/C++
- Python

Additionally, it helps to have a key computer science skill: the ability to quickly learn a wide variety of new technologies even when they are poorly documented or not documented at all.

Additional skills may be helpful for some projects:
- Machine learning
- Computer vision
- Full-stack web development
- Android / iOS

When studying the usability of a system or an interaction, we often conduct user studies.
In these cases it helps to have background in:
- Design
- Statistics
- Qualitative research methods

## How can I learn these programming skills?
### Linux
Although we specifically use [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop), most versions of Linux are very similar.
You can get practice developing C++ and Python code using practically any version of Linux.
If you are a UW CSE student, the computer labs in the basement run Fedora Linux, which you can use.

#### Trying Ubuntu
The simplest way to try Ubuntu Linux is to download it and install it onto a USB stick.
You can use this to "try" Ubuntu.
When you "try" Ubuntu, you can use all the features of Ubuntu, but any changes you make are lost as soon as you restart the computer.

- Guide on [trying Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/try-ubuntu-before-you-install)

Another way to try Ubuntu is to install a virtual machine on your system.
A virtual machine is like running a different OS inside a window of your current OS.
The two main choices to use are [VMWare Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/player/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

The disadvantage of using a virtual machine is that it is very demanding on resources.
You may find your computer running very slowly.
And, running applications inside the virtual machine is not as fast as when you actually install the OS on your computer.

#### Installing Ubuntu
You can also use this USB stick to install Ubuntu, which will erase your computer's existing operating system (e.g., Windows), and all your files, and install Ubuntu.
It is also possible to partition your hard drive into two halves, so that one half runs your existing operating system, and the other half runs Ubuntu.
This is called dual-booting.
The Ubuntu installer can help you with this, but if you are unsure of how to do this, then we don't recommend doing this.
If you make a mistake in the process, you may lose your existing operating system and files anyway.

- Guide on [installing Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop)

### Code editing tools
You will want to learn how to use some tools to edit code with inside of Linux.
Many people use graphical text editors like gedit, gvim, or Sublime.
However, in some situations, you will not have access to a graphical interface, so you will want to learn to use at least one non-graphical code editor.
The main two choices are vim and emacs.

- To learn to use vim, type `vimtutor` into a terminal
- To learn how to use emacs, type `emacs` in a terminal, then press `Ctrl+H` and then `t`

You may also want to learn to use an IDE such as Eclipse.

### C / C++
There are many online guides and books for learning C or C++.
One guide Justin likes is [Learn C the Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/), which shows how to develop C code in Linux.

### Python
There are also many online guides and books for learning Python online.
One guide Justin likes is the [Google Python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
