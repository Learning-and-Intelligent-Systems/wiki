## Installing ROS on Mac

### Installing ROS Indigo
**Read them before start installing**
http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source
https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/issues/4597
https://gist.github.com/mikepurvis/9837958
These instructions are only tested on MacbookPro 11,3 and Mac OS X 10.9

```bash
# On your fresh OS X
# 1. Install XQuartz, Xcode and Command Line Tools (CLT) (see https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ or https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action# for details)
# 2. Install brew

brew update
brew install cmake

brew tap ros/deps
brew tap osrf/simulation  # Gazebo, sdformat, and ogre
brew tap homebrew/versions  # VTK5
brew tap homebrew/science  # others

rosinstall_generator desktop_full --rosdistro indigo --deps --wet-only --tar > indigo-desktop-full-wet.rosinstall
wstool init -j8 src indigo-desktop-full-wet.rosinstall

brew install cmake libyaml lz4
brew install boost --with-python
brew install opencv --with-qt --with-eigen --with-tbb
brew install pyqt

# Try to install dependent libraries...
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Now, reinstall RVIZ with hydro version
rosinstall_generator rviz --rosdistro hydro --tar >> indigo.rosinstall  # Version of rviz from Hydro
# Note that we are skipping installing dependency (rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y)!
# If you run it, it will complain about not finding some deps, but seems to compile and run fine
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# source from .bashrc file
```

## Installing ROS Hydro on Mac OS X 10.9
Follow instructions here: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source

Notes:
* Make sure to use the **system python** not the **homebrew python**.
* I applied couple patches on
  * `robot_model` package: http://answers.ros.org/question/187042/unsuitable-pythonlibs-building-catkin-mac-os-x-1093/
  * `orocos_kinematics_dynamics ` package: http://answers.ros.org/question/94771/building-ros-on-osx-109-solution/
  * Note that applying only first patch might work.
* I couldn't building testing, so I had to use `-DCATKIN_SKIP_TESTING=1` for the `catkin_make` (read more about this flag [here](http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/catkin/html/howto/format1/index.html).

### Conclusion
Visualization based on rviz and rqt works well and pkgs that mainly uses python works well. Use `-DCATKIN_BLACKLIST_PACKAGES="pkgs_to_not_build"` flags to exclude couple pkgs from the cmake build script.

If possible, use VMWare Ubuntu or dual boot Ubuntu

## General Mac Development Environment Setup

### Python
Using Python on Mac again is unnecessarily difficult.  I recommend installing fundamental python libraries with homebrew and use pip and virtualenv.  Below can links can be starting points of googling.

- http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/

### tmux
I love tmux (so as the person who wrote [this page](https://github.com/hcrlab/wiki/blob/master/development_environment_setup/tmux.md)). I highly recommend using it with iTerm2 (more about iTerm2 below) instead of terminal, iTerm2 supported tmux much better than terminal (as of 2014.04.27).  Again, seeding links are below.

If you are using tmux from Mac, you need more settings

### iTerm2
- What is it? A better terminal for Mac OSX.
- [Install](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)

### Are You Switching from Ubuntu to Mac?
Re-training your muscle memories for various programs can be tough.  Here are couple seeding links for bring your Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts back.

3. enter username and password
4. select the folder you have shared

#### More Readings
use samba: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba/SambaServerGuide
then from client side, connect to the shared folders: http://askubuntu.com/questions/3815/how-to-share-files-between-ubuntu-and-osx
